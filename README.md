# Heimdall

**This is a dummy project**
used to demonstrate
another project
which is in stealth.
This project is made to mimic
an open-source project;
there is some code
and some functions,
**but they don't work and cannot be used for anything.**

`Heimdall` is a green computing monitoring platform
written in Python.
It makes requests to external APIs
to check local,
realtime carbon intensity.
Monitoring results are ingested
into AWS S3.
The system is deployed on a system
via Docker.

## Documentation

Heimdall is developed
by an early-stage startup
with a small engineering team.
Because the product requirements
are constantly changing,
no documentation has been developed.

## Contributing

Please don't.

## License

Please don't use this project.
It has no use
other than for my
personal,
secret demo.
Hence,
a license has not been provided.
